PC Sally Baines of West Yorkshire Police posted the appeal on Twitter on Friday, for two boys she said had never had pillows, toothbrushes or toys.
"Thousands" of gifts have been given.
Ms Baines, from Huddersfield, said she was "overwhelmed" by the generous donations, and said the boys now had "more than enough" presents.
She said a few would be chosen for the boys, who may not be able to take many with them as they are moved around the care system, but that she hoped the rest of the toys could go to children in similar situations in the Kirklees area.
The donations started after Ms Baines's first tweet, on Friday, which said: "Just been told about 2 kids under 6 who have been taken into foster care. Never had pillows, toothbrushes, toys. I am heartbroken."
