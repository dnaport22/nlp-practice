Unidentified gunmen opened fire on two police patrols before fleeing to an ancient hilltop castle and attacking a police station there, officials say.
Several tourists trapped in the castle were later freed and police were in a stand-off with gunmen as night fell.
No group has admitted carrying out the attacks.
At least 27 people have been wounded, some seriously.
"Police and security forces have surrounded the castle and its vicinity and launched an operation to hunt down the gunmen," a statement by Jordan's public security directorate said.
